# An analysis of Kickstarter campaigns
Kickstarter challenge for Module 1 of Data Analytics Bootcamp / Challenge 1
## Overview of Project
A data analysis on Kickstarter data related to Louise's theater crowdfunding campaign. Excel was used to utilize the dataset and uncover findings related to 4114 campaigns from the years 2010-2017. 
### Purpose
The purpose of this project was to analyze data about the theater campaigns that Louise had and determine trends based on years, categories/subcategories, pledges, successes/failed and see if we could uncover trends or patterns related to the goals and sub-catagory theater type of campaign. 
## Analysis and Challenges
The analysis used a chart and pivot tables. By utilizing the filter in the pivot table for Parent category and years I was better able to analyze and filter the data to limit to theater, and then limit to months (from years). I think it would have been helpful to have an additional category for percentage to understand the percentage of the success, failed, and live per months to better understand the trends. However, the pivotchart was helpful to see those trends in line form. Also, goals allowed me to take a better look at the pledge numbers, and see trends based on goal numbers for successful, failed, canceled campaigns and a category for percentage. 
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
Based on the data, we can see that plays with goals less than 1000, have a percentage successful rate of 76%, and those with pledge goals of 1000 to 4999 have a successrate of 73%. In other words, the pledge goal amounts that are the lowest have the highest success rates. We can also see 100% failure for the theater with pledged amounts of 45,0000 to 49,000. There is a peak of success at 35,000 to 39999 at 67% as well as 40000 to 44999 at 67%, respectfully. 
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
From the data of this anallysis of outcomes based on goals, we can summarize that Louise has the greatest success with pledge goals that are either less than 1000, or between 1000-4999, at 76% and 73%, respectively.
### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
My biggest difficulty with this assignment was the 2nd challenge, and using the right formula for the different columns. I really struggled with this assignment and using the right formula for Countifs and the right criteria. I found that once I was able to work through numer successful and use the >, <, = operators I was able to replicate these learnings and adjust it to the other columns based on the goal amount. It took me quite some time to figure out though, and I met with the TA for almost 2 hours. 
## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
Two conclusions that I can draw about the Outcomes based on launch date are that theater crowdfunding campaigns are more sucessful in the months of May (111 successful), and June (100 successful). Also, it appears that in total 839 theater campaigns were successful, 493 campaigns failed, and 37 were canceled in total. Also, 24 were live at the time of this analysis. Also, it appears that in the month of October, both successesses and failures took a dip in number with a downhill trend until December, only to both pick up again around February with an upward trend. 
- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
We can conclude that outcomes based on goals that plays that have goals of 0-4999 have the highest success rate compared to other goal amounts. 
- What are some limitations of this dataset?
Some limitations of this data set don't take into account other variables to account for successes or failures. Perhaps time of year, weather, or marketing campaigns could play a factor in the success or failure of Louise's campaigns. There could be other factors to consider when analyzing the success or failure that we may not otherwise consider. Another factor could also be demographics or user segment of the successful goals.
- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
We could also use a table to compare demographics of those who funded that led to successful campaigns, or compare to marketing data or marketing campaigns and relate it to the success as well.
